# variables are used for store values
# there is no command to declare variables in python
# also there no need of type of variable
# just name a variable and assign its value
# string variables can be declared either by single quotes or double quotes
# naming convention of variables as like other programming languages
variable1 = "a"  # string type
variable2 = 1 # int type
variable3 = 'Tinni'  # string type
print(variable1)
print(variable2)
print(variable3)

# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line

x, y = 'xx', 'yyyy'
print(x)
print(y)
# assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
x1 = y1 = 'xy'
print(x1)
print(y1)

# To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character
p = 'amazing'
print('world is ' +p)
p1 = 'world is '
p2 = 'cool'
print(p1+p2)
q1 = 4
q2 = 6
q3 = q1+q2
print(q3)
# but to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error
